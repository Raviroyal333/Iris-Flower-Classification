The aim is to classify iris flowers among three species (setosa, versicolor, or virginica) from measurements of sepals and petals' length and width. The iris data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.The central goal here is to design a model that makes useful classifications for new flowers or, in other words, one which exhibits good generalization.
